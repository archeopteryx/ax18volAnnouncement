	<h2>The moment you've been waiting for has arrived! Here's how to sign up for lodging for AX 2018! </h2>

	<p>
		Thank you for hanging in there with us through all of the delays and technical errors! We hope to make this process as seamless as possible, so please make sure to read these instructions all the way through.

		AX Volunteers who have completed all volunteer requirements before the deadlines are eligible to receive lodging shared with fellow AX Volunteers during the course of the convention! 
		<br><br>
		<font style="color:green;"><b>If you choose to forego lodging, you can receive a parking pass instead (with no carpool needed). In this case, sign up for a shift slot named "I DON'T NEED LODGING GIVE ME A PARKING PASS".</b></font> 
		<br><br>
		AX Volunteers who wish to receive lodging will need to sign up with the below instructions. To receive both lodging AND parking, a carpool of at least three (3) volunteers must be associated with each parking pass.
	</p>

	<br>

		<ul>
			<li>Let's start by logging into Shiftboard <a href="http://www.shiftboard.com/spja" target="_blank" style="color: blue;"><u>here</u></a>
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/14XZ37N.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li><br>

			<li>Now select CALENDAR from the top of the screen!
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zlOH187.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li><br>

			<li>Once in the CALENDAR section, select WEEK from the left hand side. (If it already says you are on WEEK, select it again to get the prompt seen in the next step). 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JrTKsWC.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li><br>

			<li>Upon selecting "WEEK," a pop up will appear. Select "Time View: Time-Stacked (Calendar)"
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vuR2XxR.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
			</li><br>

			<li>In the Time Stacked Week view, select "NEXT" until you reach July 29th!
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0NkQDze.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4bqGY1z.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
			</li><br><br>

			<li>Now that we've scooted all the way to July 29th, make sure to have the "Source" listed as "Shift view" to see the room options you can sign up for!   
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/W7z7Qga.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
				<ul>
					<li>If you would like to receive a parking pass INSTEAD of receiving lodging (where you do not need any carpool members), select the option that says "CAR - I DON'T NEED LODGING, GIVE ME A PARKING PASS"
						<br>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2v841FX.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
					</li><br>

					<li>If you have 3 preferred roommates, select one of the individual rooms (each room must have 4 people) such as "COED ROOM 8" or "FOUR PERSON FEMALE ROOM 6." There are a few SINGLE-GENDERED USC Dorm rooms that fit 2 people. (Make sure your preferred roommates communicate to choose the correct room-shift with matching names!)</li><br>

					<li>If you do not have preferred roommates or would like random roommates, select the option that says "ASSIGN ME ROOMMATES." The "ASSIGN ME ROOMMATES" option will have the VR team assign roommates for you! We usually group people within the same department, if not then same division, if not then same group. It's a great way to get to know people in similar departments.
						<br>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1orMgYF.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
					</li><br>

					<li>If a four person room says it has "4 Positions Available," then that means no one has signed up for this room yet. The same applies to a two person room saying "2 Positions Available." If a room-shift says "Available" that means there is one position left in the room, thus someone else has already signed up for that room.
						<br>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VM1OoO0.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
						<br>
						For example, the above room called "EXAMPLE DAY -2 to 5: TWO PERSON FEMALE ROOM 2" already has someone in it. 
					</li><br>

					<li>You can see who is in the "Room" before signing up for it. Don't sign up for a room with strangers (it's kind of rude). Ask permission from the people in that room before joining it! 
						<br><br> 
						To see who is in that room, change the "Source" in the upper right corner to "Shared View."
						<br>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/i7qn7Aw.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
						<br>
						Now we can see that the previous example room ("EXAMPLE DAY -2 to 5: TWO PERSON FEMALE ROOM 2") has someone named "Max Example" in it. 
						<br>
						<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nA89rnW.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
					</li><br>

					<li>If one of the SINGLE-GENDERED rooms has multiple genders in it, the room will be broken up. Members of that room will be placed into the "ASSIGN ME ROOMMATES" category.</li><br>

					<li>If a coed room is found to have all same gendered roommates, the room will be converted into a single gendered room.</li><br>
				</ul>				
			</li><br>

			<li>Let's say we want to room with "Max Example" from the above example. We just need to note that Max Example is currently in "EXAMPLE DAY -2 to 5: TWO PERSON FEMALE ROOM 2" and then return the "Source" to "Shift View" to sign up for that room! You can also use the steps in this example to sign up for a random room or to receive the parking pass instead of lodging. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ThXJ3Gg.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li><br>

			<li>Now we scroll down until we find the room-shift with the matching name! In this case, we're looking for EXAMPLE DAY -2 to 5: TWO PERSON FEMALE ROOM 2" so we can room with Max Example. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pKJ15Mx.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li><br>

			<li>Now that we've found the room, just click on the "Available" position in that room-shift. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xkksMU5.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li><br>
			
			<li>When you click on a position, the information for that room-shift will pop-up on the right side of the screen! Select "TAKE THIS SHIFT" 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZFcFkU0.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li><br>

			<li>This takes you to a new page to confirm you want this room-shift! Make sure the name matches the one you want, then select "YES, CONFIRM THIS TIME" to confirm this selection. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ORS2er4.png" style="max-width: 60%;">
			</li><br>

			<li>To confirm that we are now in the correct room with our example friend, Max Example, let's return the "Source" option to "Shared View" to check. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TrwwIxH.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li><br>

			<li>Here, we can see our example profile, named Fluffbun McBunnerson, is now in the same room as our other example profile, Max Example. Once confirmed, your room-shift sign-up is complete! 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uUVKjGj.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li><br>
		</ul>

		<h3>So that's how to sign up for AX 2018 Volunteer Lodging! But if you've accidentally signed up for the wrong room-shift, here's how to <font style="color: red;"><b>remove yourself from a room-shift</b></font> so that you can go sign up for a different one!</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In our example, we are named "Fluffbun McBunnerson," so let's change the "Source" back to "Shift View" and go search for our room-shift. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/60IQqcD.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li><br>
			
			<li>Once in "Shift View," scroll down until you find your name. Click on your name. In this example, because our name is Fluffbun McBunnerson, we click on Fluffbun McBunnerson. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X4MLyEV.png" style="max-width: 45%;">
			</li><br>

			<li>When you click on your name, this makes an infomational box appear in the right side of the screen. In that box, select "Unconfirm" to begin removing yourself from this room-shift. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/i0EV2RS.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li><br>

			<li>This takes us to a new page to make sure we want to be removed from that room-shift. Select "YES, UNCONFIRM" to finalize removing yourself from this room-shift. 
				<br>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/voENr2A.png" style="max-width: 70%;">
			</li><br>

			<li>To check and make sure we've been removed from this room, we can set the "Source" back to "Shared View" to see who is in what shift. Here, we can see that our example name, Fluffbun McBunnerson, is no longer in the room with Max Example.

	<h4> 
		<b><div style="color:red;"> NOTE IN CASE OF DROPS OR INCOMPLETE ROOMS: </div></b> 
	</h4>
	<p>
		If a four person COED room does not have four people in it by the deadline, or if someone in the COED rooms leaves the room for whatever reason after the deadline, that room will have three days to fill in the gaps until they have four people in that room. If they do not fill in to reach four roommates, the room will be dissoved into single-gendered random rooms. After June 18th, if any coed room has less than four people in it from people dropping or leaving, the room will be dissolved single-gendered random rooms regardless. Any SINGLE-GENDERED rooms that do not have four people in it (except for the two-person USC dorm rooms), will have additional random roommates added into them until they have four people in the room.
